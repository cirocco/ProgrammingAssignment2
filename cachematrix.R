#The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
#which is really a list containing a function to
#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the inverse
#get the value of the inverse

#All this uses the  <<- operator, to store the value in an object 
#outside the normal environment. Uses solve() to get the 
#inverse. 

# Comments for github testing

# The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
# created with the above function. However, it first checks to see 
# if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse 
# from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates 
# the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache 
# via the setinverse function. 

# Assumes that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
